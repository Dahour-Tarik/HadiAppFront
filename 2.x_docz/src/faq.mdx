## How can I set the default file view (grid, list) and sort function?

To set the default file view or sort order, you need to pass a valid action ID to the
relevant prop on `FileBrowser`:

```tsx
import { ChonkyActions, FileBrowser } from 'chonky';

<FileBrowser
    files={[]}
    defaultFileViewActionId={ChonkyActions.EnableListView.id}
    defaultSortActionId={ChonkyActions.SortFilesByDate.id}
>
    {/* ... */}
</FileBrowser>;
```

You can also set the action IDs globally:

```tsx
import { ChonkyActions, setChonkyDefaults } from 'chonky';

setChonkyDefaults({
    defaultFileViewActionId: ChonkyActions.EnableListView.id,
    defaultSortActionId: ChonkyActions.SortFilesByDate.id,
});
```

Note that the actions you are using should be enabled (either by default or by you).
You can use the following default action IDs:

```ts
ChonkyActions.EnableGridView.id;
ChonkyActions.EnableListView.id;
ChonkyActions.SortFilesByName.id;
ChonkyActions.SortFilesByDate.id;
ChonkyActions.SortFilesBySize.id;
```

## I want to sort the file array myself. How do I disable Chonky's built-in sorting?

You can set the default sort action ID to `null` as shown below. When a `null` value is
provided, Chonky just displays the files in the order they appear in the original
`files` array. You might also want to hide the sort buttons from the toolbar, which
can be done by passing relevant action IDs to `disableDefaultFileActions` prop.

```tsx
<FileBrowser
    files={[]}
    defaultSortActionId={null}
    disableDefaultFileActions={[
        ChonkyActions.SortFilesByName.id,
        ChonkyActions.SortFilesByDate.id,
        ChonkyActions.SortFilesBySize.id,
    ]}
>
    {/* ... */}
</FileBrowser>
```

## How can I get or set the current file selection?

You have two mechanisms available to you:

1. You can [define a custom action handler](/file-actions/action-handler) and listen
   for actions with the ID `ChonkyActions.ChangeSelection.id`. This is useful when you
   want to update React on every selection change.
2. You can use [the file browser handle](/basics/browser-handle) to get or set the
   selection at runtime. This is useful when you don't need to update React state when
   selection changes.
