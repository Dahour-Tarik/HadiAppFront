# Migrating from 1.x

## Components

-   `FileNavbar` component was added. The folder chain is now displayed in `FileNavbar`
    instead of `FileToolbar`.
-   ⚠️ `FileSearch` component was removed. The search input was moved into
    `FileToolbar`.

## Icons

-   ⚠️ To decrease the bundle size, the default FontAwesome icon component was moved
    into a separate package - `chonky-icon-fontawesome`. It is now also possible to
    provide custom icon component.

## File actions

-   ⚠️ `EssentialFileActions` were introduced. These are file actions required by Chonky
    to function correctly. They are always enabled. `DefaultFileActions` now only
    contain non-essential actions, and users can still disable them.
-   ⚠️ `toolbarButton` field was renamed into `button`. `button` object now
    needs either `button.toolbar` or `button.contextMenu` to be set to `true` to be
    displayed in respective parts of the interface. The `button.dropdown` field was
    deprecated, now `group` being truthy/falsy serves the same purpose.
-   `specialActionToDispatch` field was removed. In fact, "special" actions were
    completely deprecated. Instead, Chonky now allows actions to define the `effect`
    function that has access to Chonky's Redux state.
-   Although you can still define custom file actions using the old way (plain JS
    objects), new utility functions are provided to create type-safe action definitions.

## File action handler

-   ⚠️ The file action handler has changed completely - it is now called differently,
    and different parameters are passed in. These changes are not backwards-compatible,
    so you will need to re-define your file action handlers.

## Styling

-   ⚠️ Chonky now uses a CSS-in-JSS library called JSS. Thanks to this, you no longer
    need to import Chonky CSS manually. You can remove this line from your project:
    ```js
    // No longer needed; will throw error.
    import 'chonky/style/main.css';
    ```
-   As Chonky no longer uses plain CSS, the mechanisms for overriding built-in classes
    have changed . You can still override styles using custom CSS rules, but the class
    names in 2.x are different to 1.x.

## State management

-   Chonky now uses Redux for state management instead of Recoil. If your application
    used Chonky's internal Recoil atoms, your code will no longer receive updates.
