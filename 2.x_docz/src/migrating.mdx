# Migrating from 1.x

## Component hierarchy

-   FileNavbar component was added. The folder chain is now displayed in FileNavbar
    instead of `FileToolbar`.
-   FileSearch component was removed. The search input was moved into FileToolbar.

## Icons

-   The built-in FontAwesome icons were moved into a separate package to decrease
    bundle size. It is now possible to provide custom icon implementations (WIP).

## File actions

-   `toolbarButton` field was renamed into `button`.
-   `button` field now requires `toolbar` or `contextMenu` to be set.

## Styling

-   Chonky now uses a CSS-in-JSS library called JSS. Thanks to this, you no longer
    need to import Chonky CSS manually. You can remove this line from your project:
    ```js
    // No longer needed; will throw error.
    import 'chonky/style/main.css';
    ```
-   As Chonky no longer uses plain CSS, you can no longer override CSS properties using
    classnames. Theming and custom class name APIs will be provided in 2.x release
    (WIP).

## State management

-   Chonky now uses Redux for state management instead of Recoil. If your application
    used Chonky's internal Recoil atoms, your code will no longer receive updates.
