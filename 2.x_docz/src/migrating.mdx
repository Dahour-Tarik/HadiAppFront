# Migrating from 1.x

## Components

-   ⚠️ Explicit TypeScript types for component props are no longer exported. If you
    need the prop type of some component, use `Component['props']` notation, e.g.
    `FileBrowser['props']`.
-   FileNavbar component was added. The folder chain is now displayed in FileNavbar
    instead of `FileToolbar`.
-   ⚠️ FileSearch component was removed. The search input was moved into FileToolbar.

## Icons

-   ⚠️ The built-in FontAwesome icons were moved into a separate package to decrease
    bundle size. It is now possible to provide custom icon implementations (WIP).

## File actions

-   ⚠️ `EssentialFileActions` were introduced. These are file actions required by Chonky
    to function correctly. They are always enabled. `DefaultFileActions` now only
    contain non-essential actions, and users can still disable them.
-   ⚠️ `toolbarButton` field was renamed into `button`. `button` field now requires
    `toolbar` or `contextMenu` to be displayed. The `dropdown` field of `button` was
    deprecated, and presence/absence of `group` field is used instead.
-   `specialActionToDispatch` field was removed. In fact, "special" actions were
    completely deprecated. Instead, Chonky now allows actions to define the `effect`
    function that has access to Chonky's Redux state.

## File action handler

-   ⚠️ The signature of file action handler has changed completely. Each file action
    now defines its own payload type.

## Styling

-   ⚠️ Chonky now uses a CSS-in-JSS library called JSS. Thanks to this, you no longer
    need to import Chonky CSS manually. You can remove this line from your project:
    ```js
    // No longer needed; will throw error.
    import 'chonky/style/main.css';
    ```
-   As Chonky no longer uses plain CSS, you can no longer override CSS properties using
    classnames. Theming and custom class name APIs will be provided in 2.x release
    (WIP).

## State management

-   Chonky now uses Redux for state management instead of Recoil. If your application
    used Chonky's internal Recoil atoms, your code will no longer receive updates.
