# Defining custom actions

## File action definitions

File actions are JS objects that follow the `FileAction` interface. You can see all
supported fields in the [`FileAction` API reference][action-reference]. I suggest you
check out the API reference before reading this page to get more context. Note that `id`
is the only required file action field - all other fields are strictly optional.

In their essence, file action definitions are plain JS objects, but it is recommended to
define them using the `defineFileAction` helper method. It does some runtime checks and
Typescript magic to produce a type-safe file action. The simplified signature of this
method looks like this:

```ts
defineFileAction(action: FileAction, effect?: FileActionEffect) => FileAction;
```

You can ignore the `effect` parameter for now - it's an advanced feature, and
understanding it requires some more context about how Chonky works. The [_Understanding
effects_][effects] page talks about it in detail.

<br />

Let's look at a real example. Below you can see the definition for the `SortFilesBySize`
file action. It's a real built-in file action that is enabled by default.

```ts
import { defineFileAction, FileData } from 'chonky';
import { Nullable } from 'tsdef';

const SortFilesBySize = defineFileAction({
    id: 'sort_files_by_size',
    sortKeySelector: (file: Nullable<FileData>) => (file ? file.size : undefined),
    button: {
        name: 'Sort by size',
        toolbar: true,
        group: 'Options',
    },
} as const);
```

As you can see from the definition, it provides a `button` field with `button.toolbar`
set to `true`, meaning the button for this action will appear in the toolbar. It also
defines a `sortKeySelector` method, which will be used to sort the files when user
triggers the action by pressing its toolbar button.

After the action is triggered, Chonky starts processing it internally. Chonky executes
the action effect along with other operations the action might define - sorting,
changing file view, updating selection, etc. Finally, when all of this internal
processing is finished, Chonky calls the user-defined [file action
handler][action-handler].

### What is `as const`?

If you're new to Typescript, the `as const` suffix after the object definition in the
example above might seem unusual to you:

```ts
{
    id: 'sort_files_by_size',
    // ...
} as const
```

The `as const` suffix represents [a `const` assertion][const-assert]. It tells
Typescript to bake-in the exact type of the object, which helps you write type-safe code
later down the line.

## Defining your own action

Let's assume you want to define a new file action. You can start from this very simple
(yet valid) definition:

```ts
import { defineFileAction } from 'chonky';

const action = defineFileAction({
    id: 'my_custom_action',
    // other fields will go here
});
```

For now, the only field that is defined on your action is `action.id`. The next few
sections on this page will walk you through all the different fields you can define on
your action. You can also read the [`FileAction` API reference][action-reference] for a
short description of each field.

## Specifying action triggers

You can explicitly specify three ways to trigger your action - via a keyboard shortcut,
via a toolbar button, or via a context menu button. There are some other ways to trigger
actions as covered on [_Triggering actions_][triggers] page, but you don't have control
over them in your action definition.

### `action.button`

Setting the `button` property in your action definition will add a button to
Chonky UI that can be used to trigger your action. The value for the `button` field
should be an object following the `FileActionButton` interface:

```ts
export interface FileActionButton {
    name: string; // Button name
    toolbar?: boolean; // Whether to show the button in the toolbar
    contextMenu?: boolean; // Whether to show the button in the context menu
    group?: string; // Button group (dropdown in toolbar or section in context menu)
    tooltip?: string; // Help tooltip text
    icon?: ChonkyIconName | string | any; // Icon name
    iconOnly?: boolean; // Whether to only display the icon
}
```

Note that you should set either `button.toolbar` or `button.contextMenu` (or both) to
`true` for your button to actually appear in the UI. The `icon` field follows Chonky's
approach to icons, as laid out on [_Using icons_][icons] page.

### `action.hotkeys`

Keyboard shortcuts are defined using the `hotkeys` field. It should be an array of
strings, where each string represents a shortcut, e.g. `ctrl+q` or just `space`. See
[`hotkeys-js` documentation][hotkeys-js] for more information on how to define keys.

Please respect your users' needs when defining custom shortcuts. For example, don't
override the `ctrl+r` hotkey that already has a well-established meaning (reload page).

### `action.requiresSelection` and `action.fileFilter`

There are actions that only make sense when user has selected some files - like
downloading or deleting files. For such actions, you can set `requiresSelection` field
to `true` - this will prevent the action from being triggered until user makes a
non-empty selection. Action buttons will also be rendered in disabled state.

If you want to narrow down the selection for a particular action, you can specify the
`fileFilter` field. It's a predicate function that will be used to filter selected
files. It should follow the `FileFilter` type:

```ts
export type FileFilter = (file: Nullable<FileData>) => boolean;
```

### Action triggers example

We define two actions, both of which have toolbar and context menu buttons. You can
right click on a file entry to bring up the context menu. Note that _Delete hidden
files_ is disabled until you select a hidden file (or right-click on it). You can also
try pressing `Ctrl+O` or `Ctrl+U` on your keyboard to activate the actions.

## Changing internal Chonky state: Basics

"Internal Chonky state" includes a lot of things, some of which are pretty low-level and
complicated. However, there are also simpler concepts like current sorting function,
current file view (grid or list), boolean options, and current file selection. The file
action framework exposes simple mechanisms for you to change these 4 parts of Chonky's
state.

### `action.sortKeySelector`

`sortKeySelector` should follow the `FileSortKeySelector` type shown below. It is a
function used to determine what key your files will be sorted on. If you specify a
`sortKeySelector`, when your action is activated for the first time, the files will be
sorted on your sort key in ascending order. On subsequent activations of your action,
sort order will be toggled between ascending and descending.

```ts
export type FileSortKeySelector = (file: Nullable<FileData>) => any;
```

### `action.fileViewConfig`

`fileViewConfig` should follow the `FileViewConfig` type shown below. It is used to
switch between List and Grid views, as well as to set things like list row height or
grid thumbnail size. Note that `FileViewMode.Compact` is still experimental, and should
not be used in production.

```ts
export type FileViewConfig = FileViewConfigList | FileViewConfigGrid;
export enum FileViewMode {
    List = 'list',
    Compact = 'compact',
    Grid = 'grid',
}
export type FileViewConfigList = {
    mode: FileViewMode.List;
    entryHeight: number;
};
export type FileViewConfigGrid = {
    mode: FileViewMode.Compact | FileViewMode.Grid;
    entryWidth: number;
    entryHeight: number;
};
```

### `action.option`

`option` should follow the `FileActionOption` type shown below. It represents some
boolean flag associated with your action. Internal Chonky components or effects of other
actions can use this boolean flag to change their behaviour. `option.id` will be used to
represent this flag in Chonky's internal state. The flag will be set to the
`option.defaultValue` you provided on initial component mount. On every activation of
your action, the flag will be toggled.

```ts
export interface FileActionOption {
    id: string; // Unique option ID
    defaultValue: boolean; // Whether the option is enabled by default (required)
}
```

### `action.selectionTransform`

`selectionTransform` should follow the `FileSelectionTransform` type shown below. As the
name implies, it can be used to transform the selection in some way. The obvious use
cases are to select all files or clear the selection (and there are default built-in
actions that do exactly that). However, you can also get much more creative, like the
select the most recently edited files.

Note that the file selection in this function is represented as [an ES6 set][es6-set].
If an ID of a particular file is in the set, it means this file is selected.
`prevSelection` represents the file selection before the transform was called, and your
`selectionTransform` function should either return the new selection or `null` if you
want to leave the selection unchanged.

There are 3 other parametrs provided for your convenience. `fileIds` represents the
IDs of all files supplied to Chonky. `fileMap` represents a mapping from file ID to
file object - this is useful if you want to check some property of the file, e.g.
`fileMap[fileId].name === 'MyFile.txt'`. `hiddenFileIds` represents all files that
currently not visible to the user, e.g. because _Show hidden files_ option is `false` or
because user is currently using file search. For best user experience, you should avoid
selecting files in `hiddenFileIds`.

```ts
export type FileSelectionTransform = (data: {
    prevSelection: Set<string>;
    fileIds: ReadonlyArray<string>;
    fileMap: Readonly<FileMap>;
    hiddenFileIds: Set<string>;
}) => Nullable<Set<string>>;
```

### Example of changing Chonky's state

        const useGiantThumbnails = defineFileAction({
            id: 'use_giant_thumbnails',
            button: {
                name: 'Giant thumbs',
                toolbar: true,
                contextMenu: true,
                icon: ChonkyIconName.largeThumbnail,
            },
            fileViewConfig: {

            },
            selectionTransform: ({ fileIds, hiddenFileIds }) => {
                const newSelection = new Set();
                for (const fileId of fileIds) {
                    if (!hiddenFileIds.has(fileId) && Math.random() > 0.5) {
                        newSelection.add(fileId);
                    }
                }
                return newSelection;
            },
        });
        const fileActions = [useGiantThumbnails, useTinyThumbnails, selectRandomFiles];
        const files = [
            { id: 'zxc', name: 'Text.txt' },
            { id: 'cxz', name: 'Video.mp4' },
            { id: 'xcz', name: 'Audio.mp3' },
            { id: 'zcx', name: 'Submachine gun.mp5' },
        ];
        return (
            <div style={{ height: 300 }}>

    }}
</Playground>

## Changing internal Chonky state: Advanced topics

As stated before, the "advanced" way to change Chonky state is to use file action
effects. See [_Understanding effects_][effects] page for more information.

## Action payload type and extra state type

You might have noticed the `action.__payloadType` and `action.__extraStateType` fields.
Extra state is still an experimental feature, so you can ignore it for now. On the other
hand, the payload type is already used by some built-in actions. It is used in part
for ensuring type-safe definitions and in part for runtime payload validation.

Note that actions that define a payload type cannot have `action.button` or
`action.hotkeys` specified, because buttons and hotkeys can only dispatch actions
with a non-null payload.

The way to define `action.__payloadType` is slightly unusual. You must ensure that
Typescript infers the correct type for that field. Consider the definition for the
`OpenFiles` action:

```ts
import { defineFileAction } from 'chonky';
import { OpenFilesPayload } from 'chonky/lib/types/action-payloads.types';

const OpenFiles = defineFileAction({
    id: 'open_files',
    __payloadType: {} as OpenFilesPayload,
} as const);
```

If we wouldn't provide `as OpenFilesPayload` suffix, Typescript would infer the type of
`__payloadType` as an empty object. As an aside: in theory, the payload could be of any
type, but it's best stick to plain JS objects.
