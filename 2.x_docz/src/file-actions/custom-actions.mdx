### File action definitions

File actions should follow the `FileAction` type. They can be defined using plain JS
objects (though this is not recommended):

```ts
import { FileAction } from 'chonky';
import { selectFocusSearchInput } from 'chonky/lib/redux/selectors';

// NOT RECOMMENDED; See next example for better approach.
export const FocusSearchInput: FileAction = {
    id: 'focus_search_input',
    hotkeys: ['ctrl+f'],
    effect: ({ getReduxState }) => {
        const focusSearchInput = selectFocusSearchInput(getReduxState());
        if (focusSearchInput) focusSearchInput();
    },
};
```

A better, more type-safe, and more IntelliSense-friendly way to define file actions is
to use the `defineFileAction` helper method as shown below. This method does some
runtime checks under the hood. It can also intelligently infer things like action
payload type, and pass that information to your action handler to make it type-safe!

```ts
import { defineFileAction } from 'chonky';
import { selectFocusSearchInput } from 'chonky/lib/redux/selectors';

// RECOMMENDED
const FocusSearchInput = defineFileAction(
    {
        id: 'focus_search_input',
        hotkeys: ['ctrl+f'],
    } as const,
    ({ getReduxState }) => {
        const focusSearchInput = selectFocusSearchInput(getReduxState());
        if (focusSearchInput) focusSearchInput();
    }
);
```
