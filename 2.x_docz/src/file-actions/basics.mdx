# What are file actions?

File actions are the most powerful feature Chonky has to offer. They allow you to tweak
file browser behaviour, add custom toolbar & context menu buttons, respond to key
presses and user input, and much more!

To get a sense of how powerful file actions are, consider this - most of the
built-in Chonky features, such as file selections & context menu handling, are
implemented using Chonky file actions. In theory, the definitions for these actions
could come from user code, but Chonky provides these features out-of-the-box for
convenience.

## Quick overview

This section contains a very brief overview of different file action concepts. For
detailed documentation, check out the other pages in _File actions_ category.

### Passing custom file actions to Chonky

You can pass custom file actions to Chonky using the `fileActions` props on
`FileBrowser` component:

```ts

```

### File action definitions

File actions should follow the `FileAction` type. They can be defined using plain JS
objects (though this is not recommended):

```ts
import { FileAction } from 'chonky';
import { selectFocusSearchInput } from 'chonky/lib/redux/selectors';

// NOT RECOMMENDED; See next example for better approach.
export const FocusSearchInput: FileAction = {
    id: 'focus_search_input',
    hotkeys: ['ctrl+f'],
    effect: ({ getReduxState }) => {
        const focusSearchInput = selectFocusSearchInput(getReduxState());
        if (focusSearchInput) focusSearchInput();
    },
};
```

A better, more type-safe, and more IntelliSense-friendly way to define file actions is
to use the `defineFileAction` helper method as shown below. This method does some
runtime checks under the hood. It can also intelligently infer things like action
payload type, and pass that information to your action handler to make it type-safe!

```ts
import { defineFileAction } from 'chonky';
import { selectFocusSearchInput } from 'chonky/lib/redux/selectors';

// RECOMMENDED
const FocusSearchInput = defineFileAction(
    {
        id: 'focus_search_input',
        hotkeys: ['ctrl+f'],
    } as const,
    ({ getReduxState }) => {
        const focusSearchInput = selectFocusSearchInput(getReduxState());
        if (focusSearchInput) focusSearchInput();
    }
);
```

## Built-in vs custom file actions

_Built-in_ file actions are file actions that Chonky provides out-of-the-box. _Custom_
file actions are actions defined by the user (i.e. you).

Built-in file actions are exactly the same as custom file actions - they
extend the same `FileAction` type, they have the same permissions, and they are executed
in the exact same way. The only difference is that some built-in actions are enabled
by default, while custom actions have to be enabled explicitly.

Chonky separates built-in actions into 3 categories:

1.  **Essential file actions.** These are the file actions Chonky requires to function
    correctly. They are always enabled, and there is no way to disable them. If you know
    what you are doing, you can override an essential file action by defining a custom
    file action with the same action ID. [Click here to see essential acton
    definitions.](https://github.com/TimboKZ/Chonky/blob/2.x/packages/chonky/src/action-definitions/essential.ts)
2.  **Default file actions.** These are file Chonky provides for user convenience. They
    cover common features like file sorting, toggling hidden files, and changing file
    view. They are enabled by default, but can be easily disabled by setting
    `disableDefaultFileActions` prop on `FileBrowser` to `true`.
3.  **"Other" file actions.** These are file actions that ship with Chonky but are
    not enabled default. They cover less common scenarios like downloading files or
    creating folders. Users can enable the explicitly if they want.
