# File action basics

## What are file actions?

File actions are the most powerful feature Chonky has to offer. They allow you to tweak
file browser behaviour, add custom toolbar buttons, respond to key presses and much
more!

To get a sense of how powerful file actions are, consider this - most of the built-in
Chonky features, such as file selections & context menu handling, are implemented using
Chonky file actions. In theory, the definitions for these actions could come from user
code, but Chonky provides these features out-of-the-box for convenience.

## What can they do?

Basic functionality:

-   Change file sort function.
-   Change current file view.
-   Toggle boolean options.
-   Transform selection.
-   Add buttons to toolbar or context menu.
-   Trigger the user-defined action handler.

Using action effects, we can go further:

-   Read and modify Chonky's internal Redux state.
-   Dispatch other file actions.
-   Prevent user-defined action handler from being triggered.

## Enabling file actions

You can pass custom file actions to Chonky using the `fileActions` prop on `FileBrowser`
component:

```tsx
import { ChonkyActions, defineFileAction, FileBrowser } from 'chonky';

export const MyFileBrowser = () => {
    const myCustomAction = defineFileAction({
        /* ... */
    } as const);

    const myFileActions = [
        myCustomAction,
        ChonkyActions.UploadFiles,
        ChonkyActions.DownloadFiles,
    ];

    return (
        <FileBrowser files={[]} fileActions={myFileActions}>
            {/* ... */}
        </FileBrowser>
    );
};
```
