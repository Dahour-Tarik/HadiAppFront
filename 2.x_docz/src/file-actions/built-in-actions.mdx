# Built-in file actions

Chonky provides multiple file action definitions out of the box. Built-in actions are
exactly the same as custom actions - they extend the same `FileAction` type, they have
the same permissions, and they are executed in the exact same way. The only difference
is that some built-in actions are enabled by default, while custom actions have to be
enabled explicitly.

## Using built-in file actions

All built-in file actions are exported under the `ChonkyActions` component. You can
import them as follows:

```ts
import { ChonkyActions } from 'chonky';

console.log(ChonkyActions.ClearSelection); // Logs the entire action object
console.log(ChonkyActions.EnableListView.id); // Logs just the action ID
```

Not all built-in actions are enabled by default. You can explicitly enable file actions
by passing them to `fileActions` prop on `FileBrowser` component:

```tsx
import { ChonkyActions, FileBrowser } from 'chonky';

export const MyFileBrowser = () => {
    const myFileActions = [
        ChonkyActions.UploadFiles,
        ChonkyActions.DownloadFiles,
        ChonkyActions.DeleteFiles,
    ];

    return (
        <FileBrowser files={[]} fileActions={myFileActions}>
            {/* ... */}
        </FileBrowser>
    );
};
```

## Built-in action definitions

Chonky separates built-in actions into 3 categories - essential file actions, default
file actions and "extra" file actions.

### Essential file actions

[Click here to see essential action definitions.][src-essential]

These are the file actions Chonky requires to function correctly. They are always
enabled, and there is no way to disable them. If you know what you are doing, you can
override an essential file action by defining a custom file action with the same action
ID.

### Default file actions

[Click here to see default action definitions.][src-default]

These are file Chonky provides for user convenience. They cover common features like
file sorting, toggling hidden files, and changing file view. They are enabled by
default.

You can disable all default file actions by setting the `disableDefaultFileActions` on
`FileBrowser` component to `true`:

```tsx
<FileBrowser files={[]} disableDefaultFileActions={true}>
    {/* ... */}
</FileBrowser>
```

Alternatively, you can disable some subset of default file actions by setting
`disableDefaultFileActions` prop to an array of action IDs:

```tsx
const actionsToDisable: string[] = [
    ChonkyActions.EnableListView.id,
    ChonkyActions.SelectAllFiles.id,
];

<FileBrowser files={[]} disableDefaultFileActions={actionsToDisable}>
    {/* ... */}
</FileBrowser>;
```

### Extra file actions

These are file actions that ship with Chonky but are not enabled default. They cover
less common scenarios like downloading files or creating folders. Users can enable them
explicitly if they want.
