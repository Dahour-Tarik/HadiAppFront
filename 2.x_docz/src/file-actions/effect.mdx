# Understanding effects

It is finally time to dive deep into Chonky's most powerful feature - **file action
effects**. "Effect" in this context means a "side effect" of the action. It has nothing
to do with React's `useEffect`.

Please note that action effects are an advanced feature. As such, using them effectively
requires a fair bit of Redux knowledge and understanding Chonky's internal logic.

## Why are effects useful?

On the [_Defining custom actions_][custom-actions] page, you saw how you could change
some basic parts of Chonky's internal state, e.g. the current sorting function or
the file selection. While the mechanisms presented on that page are useful, they only
cover roughly 10% of Chonky's internal Redux state.

There's no doubt advanced users will want to read or set other parts of Chonky's Redux
state. At the same time, it is clearly impractical to provide explicit mechanisms to
alter every part of the state, because it will result in a highly fragile API that
will be hard to maintain.

Enter action effects. They provide a generic mechanism for accessing and modifying
Chonky's state by directly exposing its Redux state and Redux dispatch to developers.
This creates many interesting opportunities, like completely changing the meaning of
single & double clicks or chaining file actions. Unsurprisingly, many Chonky's built-in
actions use effects to make things happen.

There is an obvious downside to this approach - to make full use of action effects, one
should have a good understanding of what is stored in Chonky's Redux state, and what
Redux actions and thunks are available. While I agree that this is inconvenient, I also
think it is much better than the alternative, which is to fork Chonky on GitHub and
rewrite parts of code yourself.

## Action effect definition

Recall the `defineFileAction` helper method from the [_Defining custom
actions_][custom-actions] page:

```ts
defineFileAction(action: FileAction, effect?: FileActionEffect) => FileAction;
```

The second parameter is what you use to define the effect. Formally, effects should
follow the `FileActionEffect` type:

```ts
export type FileActionEffect<Action extends FileAction = any> = (data: {
    action: Action;
    payload: Action['__payloadType'];
    state: FileActionState<{}>; // extra state is empty on purpose
    reduxDispatch: ChonkyDispatch;
    getReduxState: () => RootState;
}) => MaybePromise<undefined | boolean | void>;
```

You should already know about `action`, `payload` and `state` parameters from the
[_Defining an action handler_][handler] page.

The new parameters are `reduxDispatch` and `getReduxState`. If you ever used
[Redux][redux] with [`redux-thunk` middleware][redux-thunk], you know exactly what they
do - `reduxDispatch` lets you dispatch Redux actions or thunks to Chonky's Redux
store, and `getReduxState` lets you get Chonky's internal Redux state.

### Effect return value

Note that the effect function is executed as the last step in Chonky's action processing
pipeline, right before dispatching the action to the user-defined action handler. If
you want to prevent the action handler from being called, you can return `true` from
your effect. Alternatively, you can return a promise that resolves into `true`.

### Example action effect

Consider the definition of Chonky's built-in `OpenParentFolder` action:

```ts
import {
    ChonkyActions,
    ChonkyIconName,
    defineFileAction,
    FileHelper,
    thunkRequestFileAction,
} from 'chonky';
import { selectParentFolder } from 'chonky/lib/redux/selectors';

const OpenParentFolder = defineFileAction(
    {
        id: 'open_parent_folder',
        hotkeys: ['backspace'],
        button: {
            name: 'Go up a directory',
            toolbar: true,
            contextMenu: false,
            icon: ChonkyIconName.openParentFolder,
            iconOnly: true,
        },
    } as const,
    ({ reduxDispatch, getReduxState }) => {
        const parentFolder = selectParentFolder(getReduxState());
        if (FileHelper.isOpenable(parentFolder)) {
            reduxDispatch(
                thunkRequestFileAction(ChonkyActions.OpenFiles, {
                    targetFile: parentFolder,
                    files: [parentFolder],
                })
            );
        }
    }
);
```

This action definition demonstrates two important concepts:

1. It shows that you can use any of Chonky's built-in Redux selectors by importing them
   from `chonky/lib/redux/selectors`. You can see the full list in [`selectors.ts` on
   GitHub][gh-selectors]. You can also define your own selectors if you want.
2. It shows that you can use the `thunkRequestFileAction` thunk to trigger actions from
   Chonky. The simplified method signature for this thunk looks like this:
    ```tsx
    thunkRequestFileAction(
        action: FileAction,
        payload: FileAction['__payloadType']
    ) => MaybePromise<void>;
    ```
    Note that `payload` is a required parameter. For actions that don't have a payload,
    you can just pass `undefined`.

## Available resources for action effects

File action effects rely heavily on Redux actions and selectors, so it's very useful to
understand how they work. There are many Redux resources available on Google, but you
can start with [_Redux Overview_][redux-overview] from the official Redux docs.

It is also useful to know what Redux actions, selectors and thunks Chonky actually
defines:

-   **Chonky's Redux state:**
    -   [`redux.types.ts`][gh-redux-types]: This file shows the Typescript interface
        for Chonky's Redux state.
    -   [`state.ts`][gh-state]: This file shows the initial state for Chonky's Redux
        store. Note that most of initial state is overwritten when `FileBrowser`
        component mounts, so don't rely on the contents of this file too much.
-   **Redux selectors:**

    -   [`selectors.ts`][gh-selectors]: This file shows all of the built-in Redux
        selectors. Of course you are free to define your own selectors, or just access
        the state object directly.
    -   Example usage:

        ```ts
        import { selectCleanFileIds } from 'chonky/lib/redux/selectors';

        defineFileAction(
            { id: 'selector_example_action' } as const,
            ({ getReduxState }) => {
                const cleanFileIds = selectCleanFileIds(getReduxState());
                console.log('Non-null file IDs:', cleanFileIds);
            }
        );
        ```

-   **Redux thunks:**

    -   [`files.thunks.ts`][gh-files-thunks]: This file contains thunks related to
        different file operations - setting the new file array, sorting files, setting
        the current search string, etc.
    -   [`file-actions.thunks.ts`][gh-actions-thunks]: This file contains thunks related
        to common file action operations - setting the current file view, applying a
        selection transform, toggling options, etc.
    -   [`dispatchers.thunks.ts`][gh-dispatchers-thunks]: This file contains thunks
        related to requesting and dispatching file actions.
    -   Example usage:

        ```ts
        import { thunkUpdateSearchString } from 'chonky/lib/redux/thunks/files.thunks';

        defineFileAction(
            { id: 'thunks_example_action' } as const,
            ({ reduxDispatch }) => {
                // Set search to all Photoshop files (.psd)
                reduxDispatch(thunkUpdateSearchString('.psd'));
            }
        );
        ```

-   **Redux actions:**

    -   [`reducers.ts`][gh-reducers] - This file exports the `reduxActions` constant,
        which holds all of Chonky's Redux actions. You can see that `reducers` object
        defines a bunch of functions - you can call any of them as an action. You can
        read more about [`createSlice` method from Redux Toolkit][redux-create-slice]
        to understand what is happening under the hood.
    -   Example usage:

        ```ts
        import { reduxActions } from 'chonky/lib/redux/reducers';

        defineFileAction(
            { id: 'redux_actions_example_action' } as const,
            ({ reduxDispatch }) => {
                // Disable selection
                reduxDispatch(reduxActions.setSelectionDisabled(true));
            }
        );
        ```

It is also useful for you to review the definitions of Chonky's [essential built-in
actions on GitHub][gh-essential]. They define many different effects, and they are a
good example of what action effects can do.

## Questions and suggestions

If you have a question about action effects, or want to request an addition to Chonky's
Redux state or Redux actions, you can [create an issue on GitHub][gh-issues] or [join
Chonky's Discord server][discord].

## Defining your own action effect

As you might know, you can use the `disableSelection` prop on `FileBrowser` to toggle
the file selection feature on and off. We will define a custom action that will allow
your users to toggle selection functionality from the UI (using file effects).

Try selecting some file in the file browser below then clicking on `Disable selection`
button.

<Playground>
    {() => {
        const toggleDisableSelection = defineFileAction(
            {
                id: 'toggle_disable_selection',
                button: {
                    name: 'Disable selection',
                    toolbar: true,
                    contextMenu: true,
                },
                option: {
                    id: 'disable_selection',
                    defaultValue: false,
                },
            },
            ({ reduxDispatch, getReduxState }) => {
                const disableSelectionOption = selectOptionValue('disable_selection')(
                    getReduxState()
                );
                if (disableSelectionOption) {
                    reduxDispatch(reduxActions.clearSelection());
                    reduxDispatch(reduxActions.setSelectionDisabled(true));
                } else {
                    reduxDispatch(reduxActions.setSelectionDisabled(false));
                }
            }
        );
        const fileActions = [toggleDisableSelection];
        const files = [
            { id: 'zxc', name: 'Text.txt' },
            { id: 'cxz', name: 'Video.mp4' },
            { id: 'xcz', name: 'Audio.mp3' },
            { id: 'zcx', name: 'Submachine gun.mp5' },
        ];
        return (
            <div style={{ height: 300 }}>
                <FileBrowser
                    files={files}
                    fileActions={fileActions}
                    disableDefaultFileActions={true}
                >
                    <FileNavbar />
                    <FileToolbar />
                    <FileList />
                    <FileContextMenu />
                </FileBrowser>
            </div>
        );
    }}
