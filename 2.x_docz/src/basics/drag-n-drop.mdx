# Drag & drop

Chonky supports drag & drop (DnD) out-of-the-box. The relevant functionality is
implemented using [react-dnd](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/overview).

## Disabling DnD

If you want to disable DnD globally, you can use `setChonkyDefaults`:

```ts
import { setChonkyDefaults } from 'chonky';

setChonkyDefaults({
    disableDragAndDrop: true,
});
```

To disable DnD on a specific file browser, you can use the `disableDragAndDrop` prop:

```tsx
<FileBrowser files={[]} disableDragAndDrop={true}>
    {/* ... */}
</FileBrowser>
```

## "Cannot have two HTML5 backends"

For the majority of use cases, DnD will just work. However, if you want to use multiple
`FileBrowser` instances on the same page, you will start seeing this error:

```python
Error: Cannot have two HTML5 backends at the same time.
```

This happens because of the way `react-dnd` works. It requires a `DndProvider` to be
present somewhere in the component tree, above the component that actually uses DnD
functionality. To support this, Chonky's internal component hierarchy looks like this:

```tree
- FileBrowser
    - DnDProvider
        - ChonkyDnD
```

That said, `react-dnd` also requires that only one `DnDProvider` is mounted at a time,
so when you have multiple file browsers in your app you start hitting problems:

```tsx
const MyApp = () => {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <FileBrowser files={[]} />
            <FileBrowser files={[]} />
        </React.Fragment>
    );
};
```

Resultant component hierarchy:

```tree
- MyApp
    - FileBrowser
        - DnDProvider
            - ChonkyDnD
    - FileBrowser
        - DnDProvider         <---- Duplicate provider!
            - ChonkyDnD
```

The solution is quite simple:

```tsx
import { FileBrowser } from 'chonky';
import { DndProvider } from 'react-dnd';
import { HTML5Backend } from 'react-dnd-html5-backend';

const MyApp = () => {
    return (
        <DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}>
            <FileBrowser files={[]} disableDragAndDropProvider={true} />
            <FileBrowser files={[]} disableDragAndDropProvider={true} />
        </DndProvider>
    );
};
```

The code above does two things. First, it disables Chonky's internal `DnDProvider` by
setting the `disableDragAndDropProvider` prop on `FileBrowser` to `true`. Second, it
adds a custom `DnDProvider` at the top-level of the application.

Note that you don't have to use `HTML5Backend`, you can use any `react-dnd`-compatible
backend that you want.
