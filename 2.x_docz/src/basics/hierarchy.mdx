# Component hierarchy

You already saw the `FullFileBrowser` component on the [_Installation &
usage_](/installation-usage) page:

```tsx
import { FullFileBrowser } from 'chonky';

export const MyFileBrowser = () => {
    const files = [];
    return <FullFileBrowser files={files} />;
};
```

`FullFileBrowser` is actually just a convenient alias to the code shown below. It is a
good idea to use `FullFileBrowser` if you want all Chonky's features. Plus, using it
means new componnets Chonky introduces will be enabled by default in your app!

```tsx
import {
    FileBrowser,
    FileContextMenu,
    FileList,
    FileNavbar,
    FileToolbar,
} from 'chonky';

export const MyFileBrowser = () => {
    const files = [];
    return (
        <FileBrowser files={files}>
            <FileNavbar />
            <FileToolbar />
            <FileList />
            <FileContextMenu />
        </FileBrowser>
    );
};
```

However, there are cases where you would not want all Chonky's components, for example
if you want to provide a custom implementation for something. You have the option of
leaving out the components you don't need.

The only required component is `FileBrowser`, which should appear on top level. All
other components are optional - for example, if you just want to show a list of files,
without toolbars or navigation, you would use:

```tsx
<FileBrowser files={[]}>
    <FileList />
</FileBrowser>
```

Power users might also want to provide their own implementations of different
components. For example, someone could make a custom `MyToolbar` component by cloning
Chonky's `FileToolbar`:

```tsx
<FileBrowser files={[]}>
    <MyToolbar />
    <FileList />
</FileBrowser>
```

## Component breakdown

-   `FileBrowser` - the top level component. It provides several React contexts for
    its children, including Redux store and JSS theme.
-   `FileNavbar` - navigation component. It shows the path to the current folder.
-   `FileToolbar` - main controls component. It contains a search bar and file action
    buttons.
-   `FileList` - file list component (duh). It shows files to users and lets them
    make selection or drag & drop things.
-   `FileContextMenu` - menu component. It provides the right-click menu with file
    actions.
