# File Browser handle

You can get access to a Chonky instance handle by passing a React ref to the
`FileBrowser` component:

```tsx
import { FileBrowser, FileBrowserHandle } from 'chonky';

const MyFileBrowser = () => {
    // `FileBrowserHandle` is an interface exported from `chonky`.
    const fileBrowserRef = React.useRef<FileBrowserHandle>(null);
    return (
        <FileBrowser ref={fileBrowserRef} files={[]}>
            {/* ... */}
        </FileBrowser>
    );
};
```

You can then use the file browser handle to call different methods on the Chonky
instance. At the moment, the following methods are supported:

```ts
export interface FileBrowserHandle {
    /**
     * @returns An ES6 Set containing the IDs of the selected files.
     */
    getFileSelection: () => Set<string>;
    /**
     * @param selection An ES6 Set containing the IDs of files that should be selected.
     * IDs of files that are not present in the `files` array will be ignored.
     * @param [reset=true] Whether to clear the current selection before applying
     * the new selection. When set to `false`, the new selection will be merged with
     * the current selection. Set to `true` by default.
     */
    setFileSelection: (selection: Set<string>, reset?: boolean) => void;
}
```
